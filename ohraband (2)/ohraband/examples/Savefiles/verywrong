Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates,
such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south.
Several species are found in the temperate zone, but one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the Equator.
